Normalizes UTF-8 input to Normalization Form C.

== Description ==

This is a souped-up version of the [Normalizer plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/normalizer/ "Normalizer - WordPress Plugins") by [Torsten Landsiedel](https://profiles.wordpress.org/zodiac1978/).

It adds WP filters to normalize UTF-8 data coming into the system to the [de facto web standard Normalization Form C](https://www.w3.org/International/docs/charmod-norm/#choice-of-normalization-form "Choice of Normalization Form").  The Unicode Consortium report is at [Unicode Normalization Forms](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/).

= Polyfills =

For best performance [install](http://php.net/manual/en/intl.installation.php) (if possible) the [PHP Internationalization extension `Intl`](http://php.net/manual/en/intro.intl.php), which includes the PHP class `Normalizer`.

However the plugin works without the PHP `Intl` extension being installed, as it uses (a modified version of) the [Symfony `Normalizer` polyfill](https://github.com/symfony/polyfill/tree/master/src/Intl/Normalizer).

Also text pasted into (most) inputs is normalized immediately using the JavaScript [`normalize()` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/normalize).  For browsers without normalization support, the [unorm polyfill](https://github.com/walling/unorm) is used.

= Background =

For further info, see the WP Trac ticket [#30130 Normalize characters with combining marks to precomposed characters](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30130) and this [Make WP Core comment](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/05/17/may-17-feature-projects-chat-and-prompt/#comment-30300).

The plugin also works around the Safari-specific issues raised by the WP Trac ticket [#22363 Accents in attachment filenames should be sanitized](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22363).

= Scanner =

For existing data, the plugin includes an administration tool to scan and normalize the database.  **Important:** before using this tool to normalize, please [backup your database](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Backups).  This is especially important if your database contains non-normalized serialized data, as this plugin uses the same suck-and-see technique as interconnect/it's [Database Search and Replace Script in PHP](https://interconnectit.com/products/search-and-replace-for-wordpress-databases/) to deal with serialized data, and is fallible.

= And =

A google-cheating schoolboy French translation is supplied.

The plugin should run on PHP 5.2.17 to 7.1, and on WP 3.9.13 to 4.7.1.

The project is on [github](https://github.com/gitlost/unfc-normalize).

== Installation ==

Install in the standard way via the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress and then activate. No further action is needed.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I normalize extra stuff? =

You can add normalization to anything that passes its content through a filter. The canonical way is to use the `unfc_extra_filters` filter which returns an array of filter names - for instance, in your theme's `functions.php` file, add:

	function mytheme_unfc_extra_filters( $extra_filters ) {
		$extra_filters[] = 'myfilter';
		return $extra_filters;
	}
	add_filter( 'unfc_extra_filters', 'mytheme_unfc_extra_filters' );

Note that the `unfc_extra_filters` filter is only called in the administration backend. You can also add a filter directly, to be called in the frontend or backend, by referencing the global PHP variable `unfc_normalize`, but you should ensure that the `Normalizer` polyfill is loaded if you don't have the PHP `Intl` extension installed:

	global $unfc_normalize;
	if ( $unfc_normalize ) {
		if ( ! function_exists( 'normalizer_is_normalized' ) ) { // If the "Intl" extension is not installed...
			$unfc_normalize->load_unfc_normalizer_class(); // ...load the polyfill.
		}
		add_filter( 'myfilter', array( $unfc_normalize, 'normalize' ), 6 /* Or whatever priority you choose */ );
	}

= Does it have a tool to normalize the filenames of files uploaded prior to its enabling? =

No, it doesn't. Alas, such files would have to re-uploaded. However if (enough - or more like any) interest were expressed...

== Screenshots ==

1. Before and after: pasting non-normalized text into a post's title and content.
2. Before: uploading a file on macOS with Firefox and then viewing with Safari (broken in Safari).
3. After: uploading a file on macOS with Firefox and then viewing with Safari (whee it works).
4. Front page of the database scan administration tool.
